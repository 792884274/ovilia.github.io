<p class="title">How to learn JavaScript in a week</p>
<p>So, you want to learn JavaScript in a week?</p>
<p>Yes, that's possible. And you can even learn JavaScript in an hour if you call writing a <span class="term">Hello World</span> program so.</p>
<p>My favourite programing language was C++ when I met with JavaScript for the first time, which was two years ago. Like most of new JavaScript programers, I thought it was easy to get used to JavaScript.</p>
<p>I used JavaScript but was thinking in C++. When I met with JavaScript problems, I would thought of how to solve it in C++ and then search for a similar solution in JavaScript. Thus, without the thorough understanding of JavaScript, I used it for the last two years. Then, in <a href="http://01org.github.com/jWebAudio/" target="_blank">a project</a> I did in my internship in Intel recently, I noticed the importance of having a complete understanding of JavaScript.</p>
<p>I took the different ways of implemening inheritance as different approaches to the same target. But it turned out that they are different patterns used in different situations. And without the thorough understanding of JavaScript, I won't even notice that there's a problem, let alone solving it by searching.</p>

<p class="title">Time for a further step</p>
<p>I noticed the treasure of JavaScript when reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Wrox-Guides/dp/0764579088" target="_blank">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a>. Now, decided to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/" target="_blank">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> and write blogs of it.</p>

<p>As the author said in preface:<p>
<div class="citeLeft"></div>
<div class="cite">
    <p>This is a book about the JavaScript programming language. It is intended for programmers who, by happenstance or curiosity, are venturing into JavaScript for the first time. It is also intended for programmers who have been working with JavaScript at a novice level and are now ready for a more sophisticated relationship with the language. JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful language. Its unconventionality presents some challenges, but being a small language, it is easily mastered.</p>
    <p>My goal here is to help youto learn to think in JavaScript. I will show youthe components of the language and start you on the process of discovering the ways those components can be put together.</p>

<p>I'll write series blogs about the notes and experiments of the book. Keep watching! :D</p>
